CRUD Front End using Webpack &amp; Babel


This is the final beginning JavaScript course project, think of building something similiar to Twitter in JavaScript, based on using npm to build the project from https://github.com/bradtraversy/babel_webpack_starter

with https://github.com/typicode/jsonplaceholder acting as a Fake Rest API.

Thanks!
